      <p>Hi, my name is Cory McShea, and I welcome you to my Portfolio page. After earning a BA degree at Northeastern University, and nearly 10 years of experience in the Financial Services Industry, I have decided it is about time for a career switch. 
      <br><br>
      With the help of Nick, and his trusty TA’s, I fully expect to become an expert in full-stack web development! If that is not the case, I have no one else to blame besides Nick and the Trilogy staff!
    <br><br>
      The next 6 months of my life will be interesting to say the least. I have a 20-month-old son, Conor, at home, and my wife and I are currently expecting a baby girl in June. Will there be time to sleep, eat, or maybe get in a round of golf? Not likely, but it will be worth it when I begin my new career in Web Development!
